## Process
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Used Power Query in Power BI to:
  - Handle missing values (e.g., empty cells).
  - Format and standardize data for analysis.
  - Create relationships between tables for effective modeling.

### 2. Dashboard Creation
- Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize:
  - Revenue and profit contributions by market and customer.
  - Trends in sales over time.
  - Performance comparison between regions and customer types.

## Key Insights
### Revenue Contribution
- Delhi contributed the highest revenue at **54.66%**, followed by Mumbai (**14.19%**) and Ahmedabad (**12.66%**).
- Other markets have significantly lower revenue contributions. Marketing efforts should target these underperforming markets.

### Profit Analysis
- **Bhubaneswar** leads in profit percentage at **10.48%**, followed by Hyderabad (**6.71%**) and Chennai (**6.34%**).
- Interestingly, Delhi generates the most revenue but not the highest profit. Bhubaneswar and other cities should be targeted to enhance revenue and profit simultaneously.

### Profit Contribution by Market
- Mumbai (**23.89%**) and Delhi (**22.13%**) contribute the most to overall profits, followed by Ahmedabad (**19.06%**).
- This highlights a mismatch between revenue and profit generation across markets.

### Revenue vs. Sales Trends
- Revenue peaked in **February 2020** but has seen a decline since, with a noticeable drop in **June 2020**.

### Customer Contribution
- **Excel Stores** contributed the highest profit (**12.54%**), followed by Surge Stores (**11.95%**), despite Electricalsara Stores leading in revenue contribution (**46.15%**).
